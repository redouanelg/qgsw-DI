## Learning Generalized Quasi-Geostrophic Models Using Deep Neural Numerical Models

Lguensat et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08856

This repository presents the PyTorch written one-layer quasi geostrophic model used for the paper, this code is adapted for GPU use and could serve for training neural networks as done in the paper. To run properly you must use double precision (float64). For the moment it does not deal with land pixels, any help/collaboration is appreciated.

I am cleaning the code for the experiments presented in the paper and get the authorization from CNES to share the code. Stay tuned.
